    "The notebooks in this folder provide the means for generating a cropland mask (crop/non-crop) for the Western Africa study region (Figure 1), for the year 2019 at 10m resolution. To obtain classifications a Random Forest algorithm is trained using training data in the `data/` folder (`Western_training_data_<YYYYMMDD>.geojson`). The entire algorithm is summarised in figure 2.\n",

    "The definition of cropping used to collect the training data is:\n",

    "    “A piece of land of minimum 0.16 ha that is sowed/planted and harvest-able at least once within the 12 months after the sowing/planting date.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition will exclude non-planted grazing lands and perennial crops which can be difficult for satellite imagery to differentiate from natural vegetation.\n",
