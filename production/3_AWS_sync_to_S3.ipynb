    "We can use ```awscli``` to sync seed data into s3 to validate the s3 path as well as other setups.\n",

    "3. product version\n",
    "4. ```<x>/<y>``` tile index\n",

    "It is possible to use localstack to mock s3. But it needs extra tweaking.\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "Remember to add ``` --acl public-read``` when sync the data to real s3. Prepare the data in ```v0.1.4``` with the\n",
    "exact folder structure as the s3 key prefix you want. Then, sync data,\n",

    "  ```bash\n",
    "  aws s3 sync <local data path> <remote s3 bucket and prefix> --acl public-read\n",
